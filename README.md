# Hand-Gesture-AI
Hand Gesture AI is an intelligent computer vision system that detects, tracks, and classifies human hand gestures in real time using deep learning and advanced image processing techniques. The system leverages tools like MediaPipe, OpenCV, and optionally deep learning models for accurate and responsive gesture recognition.
